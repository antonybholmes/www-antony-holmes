There is an entire industry built on making investing seem complicated so you can be sold services but it doesn't have to be. There is a **default option**. Unless you have a good reason to do something differently, you should go with the default options. Thet are tried and tested methods that should work for anyone. As you learn more, you may add some bells and whistles, but even if you never change a thing with your investment plan, this is the way to go.

<ol class="list-decimal list-inside">
<li class="mt-2">Save at least **20%** of your gross income, every year, toward retirement.</li>
<li class="mt-2">If you have access to a pre-tax investment option such as a 401K, try to max that out especially if you get a company match. Next try to fill your Roth IRA or Roth 401K. Finally use a taxable brokerage account for any remaining money you want to invest.</li>
<li class="mt-2">Use the <a class="text-blue-500" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Graham">Benjamin Graham</a> rule of thumb and invest 25-75% of your money in risky investments such as stocks, and the rest in relatively safe investments, such as bonds.  Don't change this ratio no matter what the markets do. Plan to decrease your investments in stocks over time and re-evaluate your plan every 5-10 years</li>
<li class="mt-2">Use a low-cost total stock market index mutual fund and one low-cost total bond market index mutual fund for your investments. You don't need anything else regardless of what you may read.</li>
<li class="mt-2">Make your invesments at a reputable low cost brokerage Mutual Fund Company such as Vanguard, Fidelity or Schwab. All of these are great companies so pick the one you like best.</li>
</ol>

<p class="mt-8">These defaults are simple, easy to understand, effective, and very low-cost. Unbiased experts agree that If you follow this strategy, you will reach a comfortable retirement. It is possible you can do a little better than this, but it is also easy to do much worse. Considering the very little amount of effort and expertise required, this method of investing has the best ratio I know of results: effort/expertise required.</p>
