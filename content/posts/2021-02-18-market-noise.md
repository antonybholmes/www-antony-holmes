The financial press, but really all the major news sites on TV, the radio, and the web make a lot of noise reporting stock market news updates, but really very little of it is useful or actionable. Knowing what the Dow Jones or S&P 500 indices did on a given day is not useful for your long term retirement goals. You should ignore it.

<h2 class="mt-6">Why should you care what the market did today? I don't</h2>

No serious investor cares about one day's stock market movements. If you're investing for 5, 10, 20, or 30 years, a single day doesn't matter. If the markets went up, great: do nothing. If the markets went down, you shouldn't be doing anything either.

<h2 class="mt-6">The Media Reports The Wrong Indices</h2>

The most common index that measures the whole stock market is called the Wilshire 5000. It measures the movement of thousands of stocks. Never heard of it you say? I'm not surprised. A similar one is called the Russell 3000. Haven't heard of that one either huh? But of course, you've heard about the Dow, 10 times a day for your entire life. The Dow only measures 30 stocks, so it is much less representative of the overall market than the more comprehensive indices.
Even worse is when they report the Nasdaq. This is a leftover from the dot.com bubble days. So many people were buying tech stocks which were predominantly traded on the Nasdaq exchange that the media started reporting on the changes in the Nasdaq index as a proxy for how one narrow segment of the market, tech stocks, were doing.

It would be just as interesting to hear about how energy stocks or real estate stocks were doing. If you're not going to talk about all the market sectors (and please don't) why bother reporting this one? There are three stock exchanges in the United States. The Wilshire 5000 contains stocks from all of them. The Nasdaq? Well, just one. How useful is that? The New York Stock Exchange has its own index, the NYSE Composite Index. How come you never get to hear about that? More money is traded on the NYSE each day than on the Nasdaq. Sometimes, you get to hear about the “S&P”, or the S&P 500. Although this stock index only contains the stocks of 500 large companies instead of the nearly 7000 traded in the US, at least it has a pretty high correlation with the overall market.

It's about time the media became financially literate and started reporting something that actually matters to the individual investor.
