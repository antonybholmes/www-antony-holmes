Another important rule of thumb is to understand is the 4% rule. 4% is the amount you can withdraw from a portfolio each year and expect it to last you through retirement. You get to increase that 4% with inflation each year. That means that to retire you need a portfolio 25 times bigger than the amount you plan to spend from it each year. Where does this rule come from? Put on your evidence-based investing hats and follow me to what is called “The Trinity Study.” This study came out of Trinity University, and was recently updated. The researchers divided all our past financial data into rolling 30 year periods (from 1929-2009, so 53 overlapping 30-year periods), then tested how likely the portfolio was to survive for the whole 30 years at various asset allocations and various withdrawal rates. Back in the 90s, there was this idea prevalent in the financial planning community that if the stock market returned 7-12% a year, you could spend 7-12% of your portfolio every year in retirement and expect it to last. This important study threw a lot of cold water on that idea. It turned out if you were spending more than 5% of your portfolio a year (again, adjusted to inflation), you would be very lucky if your portfolio lasted 30 years. Let's look at the data from the study. This is the most important table from the paper:
