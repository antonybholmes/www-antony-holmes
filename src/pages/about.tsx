            Hello, I am the The Polite Investor, a polite Englishman (what what)
            that has been living in the US for 10 years. Although I have always
            been interested in personal finance and investing, once my employer
            enrolled me in their 401(k) (we do not have those in the UK) I
            thought it was time to get serious and figure out how the financial
            system works and how to make sound investment choices. As something
            of a naive on such matters, I thought I would start this site to
            document my financial journey and offer my opinions. Perhaps you
            might learn something from my experiences and together we can all
            try to lead better financial lives.
          </p>

            Income Does Not Automatically Equal Wealth Too many people confuse
            income and consumerism with wealth. The trappings of a middle class
            lifestyle can lead people to keep up with the Jones and spend
            everything they have on a high consumption lifestyle. I believe the
            key to building wealth is disiplined saving and investing coupled
            with a somewhat minimalist lifestyle regardless of income. You don't
            need stuff and you should have a healthy skepticism towards
            activities your peers engage in: mortgages, expensive cars,
            expensive vacations. You'll find a little bit of my personal
            philosophy peppered throughout this site.
