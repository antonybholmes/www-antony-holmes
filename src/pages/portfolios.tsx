          <h1>You've Got To Pick A Portfolio Or Two</h1>

          <p>
            Starting a porfolio might seem daunting, afterall there are
            thousands of stocks, ETFs and funds to choose from, so how do you
            start and what makes a perfect portfolio? The truth is that no one
            knows which portfolio is going to outperform in the future. You can
            change all the factors you want â€” more or less diversification,
            additional risks/factors, lower costs vs additional risk or
            diversification, more of this and less of that. Does it matter?
            Absolutely. Take a look at Madsinger's Monthly Report some time,
            where a Bogleheads poster has been tracking the returns of a dozen
            balanced portfolios for the last decade. But it doesn't matter that
            much. No diversified portfolio in that report has done better than
            1-2% per year more than a similarly risky portfolio over the last 15
            years. Now 1-2% does matter, especially over long periods of time,
            but keep in mind the edge that a very complex portfolio might
            provide over a very simple one can easily be eaten up by advisory
            fees, behavioral errors, and poor tax management.
          </p>

          <h2 className="mt-4">Stick With It</h2>
          <p>
            I suggest you pick a portfolio you like and stick with it for a few
            decades. Eventually, any given investment portfolio will have its
            day in the sun. Just don't continually change your portfolio in
            response to changes in the investment winds. This is the equivalent
            of driving while looking through the rearview mirror, or, as Dr.
            Bernstein likes to phrase it, skating to where the puck was.
            <p>
              This is a list of some starting portfolios you can use and adapt
              to your own needs. These portfolios will often use Vanguard funds
              as a basis, but where possible I have included equivalent low cost
              Fidelity and Schwab fund equivalents. I can't say which is the
              best, but long term all of them should serve you well. I have
              included links to{" "}
              <BlueLink to="https://portfoliovisualizer.com">
                Portfolio Visualizer
              </BlueLink>{" "}
              so you can backtest these portfolios to see how they performed
              over time and an array of market conditions. The usual caveat is
              that past performance does not guarantee the future, but you can
              get an idea of what will happen in various scenarios such as bull
              or bear market.
